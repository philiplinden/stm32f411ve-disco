//! # Microphone Example
//!
//! This example demonstrates the MP45DT02 MEMS microphone interface.
//! Due to current limitations, this is a simplified demonstration that shows
//! the API structure but returns dummy audio data.
//!
//! ## What This Example Does
//!
//! - Initializes the MP45DT02 MEMS microphone
//! - Demonstrates the recording API (simplified)
//! - Shows how audio samples would be read
//! - Displays sample data (currently dummy values)
//!
//! ## Running the Example
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo run --example microphone
//! ```
//!
//! **Note:** This is a demonstration of the API. Full PDM audio capture
//! requires I2S/SPI peripheral configuration with DMA and decimation filtering.
//!
//! ## Hardware Used
//!
//! - MP45DT02 MEMS Microphone
//!   - PDM_OUT: PC3 (PDM data output)
//!   - CLK_IN: PB10 (Clock input to microphone)
//!
//! ## Current Limitations
//!
//! Full microphone functionality would require:
//! - I2S peripheral in PDM receive mode
//! - DMA for continuous PDM bit stream capture
//! - CIC (Cascaded Integrator-Comb) decimation filter
//! - Low-pass filtering for anti-aliasing
//! - PDM to PCM conversion
//!
//! ## MP45DT02 Specifications
//!
//! - Omnidirectional MEMS microphone
//! - PDM digital output
//! - 64 dB SNR
//! - -26 dBFS sensitivity
//! - 120 dBSPL acoustic overload point
//! - 1.6-3.6V supply voltage
//!
//! ## Understanding PDM Audio
//!
//! PDM (Pulse Density Modulation) is a high-frequency (MHz) 1-bit stream
//! that encodes audio amplitude in the density of pulses. Converting PDM
//! to usable PCM audio requires:
//! 1. Oversampling the PDM stream (typically 64x)
//! 2. Decimation filtering to reduce sample rate
//! 3. Low-pass filtering to remove high-frequency noise
//!
//! ## Audio Sample Format
//!
//! The example uses 16-bit signed integers (i16) for audio samples:
//! - Range: -32768 to +32767
//! - 0 = silence
//! - Positive = compression
//! - Negative = rarefaction
