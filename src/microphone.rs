/// - Basic GPIO control for demonstration

/// - Placeholder for audio capture functions
/// 
/// ## Full Implementation Would Require
/// - I2S peripheral configuration in PDM mode
/// - DMA setup for continuous data streaming
/// - CIC decimation filter for PDM to PCM conversion
/// - Low-pass filtering for anti-aliasing
